# Data Structures & Algorithms  using `Clojure`
 This project meant to learn and implement different data structures and algorithm using clojure.
 If you are newbee and what to explore clojure then this project is meant for you. Happy learning! 


# Basics
#### Data Structures
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.
There are various types of data structures like:
* [Array]()
*  [LinkedList ]()
*  [Stack]()
*  [Queue]()
*  [Binary Tree]()
*  [Binary Search Tree]()
*  [Heap]()
*  [Graph]()
etc.

#### Algorithms
Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.
From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −
* Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
* Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
* Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
* Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
* Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures −
* Fibonacci number series
* Knapsack problem
* Tower of Hanoi
* All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
* Shortest path by Dijkstra
* Project scheduling
